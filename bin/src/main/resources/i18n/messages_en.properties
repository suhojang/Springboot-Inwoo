inwoo.inwoo_c.cont3=<div>Inwoo Corporation, established on April 6th 1993 as a small company, has been developed itself continuously.<br><br>We always have sought for new items and opened new markets to enter into. Now we are supplying world's best products across the nation from over 16 countries and 30 suppliers, trying to contribute to nation's petrochemical industry.<br><br>Major products that we are covering are industrial emulsifiers, fuel markers, fuel and lubricating additives, aroma chemicals and raw materials for flavor and fragrances, catalysts and absorbents, thermoplastics etc. All of them are being supplied for diverse petrochemical enterprises and oil refineries leading Korean economy.<br><br>Up to now, those companies are using products supplied by Inwoo with reliability. We could say that we are known as a small but reliable company in petrochemical industry, which means that we are acknowledged as one of the most trusted companies from our customers, Especially, Inwoo is focusing on it's members' self developments through various educations such as foreign language and practical trading. In addition to above mentioned, Inwoo is offering opportunities such as overseas training for gifted employees in order to support them to grow confidence and enthusiasm.<br><br>All Inwoo members are gearing our capabilities to perform given tasks from the beginning to the end with responsibility so that our customers can have the impressions that we are a reliable partner.<br><br>Although all companies have similar ideas, especially for Inwoo, the investment for it's members is really important because we believe that it is the ultimate source for company's continuous growth. Our investment for our employees made them to trust the organization and to ntribute for our customers. These came to fruition as many desirable results such as being awarded from the Minister of Commerce, Industry and Energy in 2001, winning 3 million dollars of export prize in 2002 and honoring from prime minister in 2006.<br><br>However, Inwoo is not content with the status quo, and now challenging for a new goal thinking it will be the 2nd start. We established our own technical research center from 2006 and started to research in order to develop eco-friendly products by ourselves.<br><br> All of these efforts will serve as a stepping-stone for Inwoo to grow as a global enterprise by developing core materials. Those materials will be helpful for nation's future chemical industry and will be applicable for a patent both in domestic and foreign market.<br><br>And Inwoo established a China office in Shanghai in 2006. Thanks to the Shanghai office, we are able to accelerate expansions abroad and development for new items.<br><br>This will be a foundation stone for establishing branch offices in major countries in the long term and also will play a role as an export outpost for Inwoo's future products. <br><br>'Always be the best friend' is our motto that we are always reflecting.<br><br> Inwoo family will do our best to keep cultivating gifted workers and spending our resources for innovative technologies. We will not be afraid to face future challenges and will always respect our customers.<br><br>Please show your warm interests to us. We would appreciate your wise advices and affectionate encouragements, promising we will also do our best to live up to your expectations.<br><br><br>Thank you for reading.</div>
